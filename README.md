# native_cursor

Native cursors for GameMaker!

(on Windows. Later HTML5 - have to rewrite everything from scratch)

## What's interesting here

Just a bunch of WinAPI things, really. Made slightly more complex by the fact that I wanted this to be a tiny DLL.

Did you know that if you do

```cpp

```
